Application of hybrid seasonal ARIMA GARCH model in modelling  and forecasting of fertilizer prices in Kenya

The objective of this research was to create a hybrid SARIMA GARCH model for fertilizer
price prediction in Kenya. In addition, the study was designed to determine whether the
model could be used to select the optimum port for fertilizer import at various periods and to
determine whether the port through which fertilizer is imported affects the price charged. To
conduct this study, we cleansed the data and transformed it using sophisticated algorithms
to guarantee a valid result. Then, the GARCH, SARIMA, and Hybrid SARIMA GARCH
techniques were used to analyze fertilizer price trends.
